# LITA_Class_Documentation
A documentation of my class on Data Analysis with the Incubator Hub and Project work.

## Project Title: 
Data Analysis- Basics of Data Analysis

### Project Overview:
The aim and objective of this project is to have a good knowledge and understanding of Data Analysis, Foundations of Data - Data Generation, Data storage, Data Source, Data Structure, introduction to MSExcel, Basic Excel Functions, Reports and Dashboards in Excel, Project/Challenge.

### Data Sources: 
The primary source of Data is from LITA, CSV, and this an open source that can be freely downloaded from an open source online like kaggle.com, data.gov etc.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. Data Generation and cleaning
  2. Explore and Visualize Data  
  3. Analyze Data
  4. Tell stories with Data
- SQL - Structured QUery Language for quering of Data
- GitHub for portfolio building
- Power BI

### FOUNDATIONS OF DATA
We need to have some level of Data Litracy, that is how we perceive Data so we can do some certain things or make meaning out of the Data set. These include

- Data Generation:
  
The way you generate your data would actually impact some of the things you would do with your Data afterward. The better the generated Data, the more value we get from our Data set.

- Data Cleaning:
This is the process of detecting and correcting corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.

- Data Storage:
The generated data must be stored somewhere so that the data set is accessible, else we loose the Data. And this can be done in 2 ways - premises or cloud.

- Data Structure:
 This is a data organization and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. And this can bee achieved in 3 ways - STRUCTURED DATA, a structured data simply means data is in a table format, also a structured Data is 90% ready for analysis. SEMI STRUCTURED DATA means data is not in a table format but in format like JSON, XML while UNSTRUCTURED DATA comes from audio, video, they are the media files.

 We do what is called ETL- Extract Transform and Load to restructure our data to bring our data to a structure that is reporting or analysis ready. ETL is simply the process of making our data set analysis ready

 ### DATA ANALYSIS LIFE CYCLE
 
 This is a cyclical process for gathering, analysing, and interpreting data. The phases are as shown below:
 
 - Ingestion: To connect to data source, to socket in
 - Transformation: once data is brought in, you may want to add or drop columns , change the data type etc. This is typically the ETL.
 - Modelling: Data modeling refers to the architecture that makes analysis possible. Here an Analyst brings different data close to one another to be able to bring out a single Report.
 - Visualization: This means simply turning data into visuals, charts, graphs. Visualization is what many people will see
 - Analysis: Data is evaluated and described by applying statistical and Logical techniques.
 - Presentation: Data is ready for presentation.

 
### Data cleaning Using Power BI 
 Recall that Data Cleaning means removing unwanted observations, outliers, fixing structural errors. It is also the process of detecting and correcting corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.

 ### Shown below are some TEXT Cleaning done Using Power BI

TEXT - CLEANING 2. Here I started by:
1. got my Data
2. Took it for Transformation
3. Removing empty 2 top rows, 
4. Replacing all the null values with @lita.org by clicking on REPLACE VALUES, 3. 3. Then removed the bottom 5 rows
5. Promoted the Header using USE FIRST ROW AS HEADERS
6. Removed the bottom 5 rows
7. Duplicated the Name column and SPLITED the Name copy column created by SPACE delimeter, at LEFT-MOST DELIMITER to get the First Name and Surname column having copied and removing the Original First Name and Surname Column
8. I then MERGE the First Name with the Email to form the Email address Column having duplicated the Email column.
9. Then finally renamed the Email Address column.

TEXT - CLEANING 3. Here: 
1. I got my Data
2. Took it for Transformation
3. I first removed Top 2 rows
4.  Removed an empty column
5. Removed bottom 5 rows
6. Promoted the header using first row as header
7. Then duplicated the First Name and the Surname and creating additional column copy respectively
8. I then copied and Removed the Full Name column
9. and finally MERGED the two column copies by SPACE seperator to get the Full Name.

TEXT - CLEANING 4. Here, after generating my Data and taking it for transformation: 
1. I first removed Top 2 rows
2. Removed an empty column
3. Promoted the header using first row as header
4. Removed bottom 5 rows
5. Duplicated the Email Address column
6. Then SPLITED the created column copy by @ delimiter at each occurrence of the delimiter
7. Then removed the unwanted columns (@lita.org) out of the 2 additional created columns
8. Again splitted the remaining column of the previous created column (the first name.surname) by dot (.) seperator at Left-most delimiter
9. And finally, I copied and removed the First Name and Surname column respectively and renamed them respectively.


# MY PROJECT WORK IN DATA ANALYSIS WITH THE INCUBATOR HUB

## PROJECT TITLE: SALES AND CUSTOMERS DATA ANALYSIS

## PROJECT 1: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store

### Project Overview/Summary: This Project is base on two dataset Analysis, simply named Project 1 and 2.

In Project 1, I analyzed the sales performance of a retail store. 
I explored the sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional 
performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI 
dashboard that highlights these findings

In Project 2, customer data subscription service was analyzed to identify 
segments and trends. This was aimed at understanding customer behavior, track subscription types, 
and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI 
dashboard that presents my analysis.

### PROJECT 1 Procedure:

### 1. Using Excel:
   
i. I Performed an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize 
total sales by product, region, and month and the results are as shown below:

![Total sales by product, region, and month](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9da38aa-538a-43b9-8e9b-eda30f5905c4)

#### From the Total Sales by Product Pivot Table:
- Shoes made the highest sale of  3,087,500
- Followed by shirt at 2,450,000
- Socks made the leastt sales of 912,500

#### From the Total Sales by Region Pivot Table:

- South made the highest sales of  4,675,000
- Followed by East at 2,450,000
- while the lowest sale came from West at 1,512,500

#### From the Total Sales by Month Pivot Table:

The sales are as shown below in Descending order
Feb	 2,750,000 

Jul	 1,387,500 

Jan	 1,250,000 

Jun	 1,250,000 

Aug	 1,025,000 

Oct	 675,000 

Mar	 537,500 

Nov	 525,000 

May	 525,000 

Dec	 250,000 

Apr	 237,500 

Sep	 175,000 

September having the lowest sale should be as a result of school Resumption where parents and Guardian has to pay more attention to paying of school fees, and other school things.

#### From the Pivot Tables above the Grand Total is 10,587,500 

 ii. I Used Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as:
 
 - AVERAGE SALE PER PRODUCT

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/538ff9ab-7424-4913-b1e0-91285932204a)


```=AVERAGEIF(C2:C50001,C2,H2:H50001)```       Shirt	      326.6666667 = 327

```=AVERAGEIF(C2:C50001,C49983,H2:H50001)```   Shoes	      308.75 = 309

```=AVERAGEIF(C2:C50001,C49984,H2:H50001)```   Hat	        158.75 = 159

```=AVERAGEIF(C2:C50001,C49985,H2:H50001)```   Socks	      121.6666667 = 122

```=AVERAGEIF(C2:C50001,C49986,H2:H50001)```   Jacket	    140

```=AVERAGEIF(C2:C50001,C49987,H2:H50001)```   Gloves	    200

- TOTAL REVENUE BY REGION
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cd76cbe-5dae-437f-a52a-21b1b9d885c8)

South	4,675,000   ```=SUMIF(D2:D50001,D49983,H2:H50001)```

East	2,450,000   ```=SUMIF(D2:D50001,D49984,H2:H50001)```

West	1,512,500   ```=SUMIF(D2:D50001,D49989,H2:H50001)```

North	1,950,000   ```=SUMIF(D2:D50001,D49982,H2:H50001)```

TOTAL 10,587,500  ```=SUM(M12:M15)```
 
iii. Creating other interesting report:

The charts below summarizes the Sales Report at a glance

![SALES REPORT 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b882ab7-0ff7-4a36-bf97-aa87f791bfa1)


### 2. Using SQL:

#### I loaded the Salesdataset into my SQL Server environment so I can write and 
validate my queries. The following queries were done:

- To see my SalesData Table, I wrote the query below:

      ```select*from salesdata``` 

- Then I alter the SalesData Table to create additional column called TotalSales by writing the query below:

   ```ALTER TABLE salesdata
  
    ADD TotalSales int```

- Then UPDATE the SalesData Table with the query below:

   ```UPDATE SalesData SET TotalSales = Quantity*UnitPrice```

The Image below are the SQL Queries as entered in SQL Server

![SQL QUERIES](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2991865-41c9-4689-9dd8-bf75c2ceb04f)


- Then, I was able to Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions: 

i. Retrieve the total sales for each product category

   ```SELECT Product, SUM(TotalSales) AS TOTAL_SALES
        FROM SalesData
           GROUP BY Product```

ii. Find the number of sales transactions in each region

    ```SELECT Region, COUNT(Customer_Id) AS Number_of_sales_transaction
         FROM SalesData
           GROUP BY Region```

iii. Find the highest-selling product by total sales value

    ````SELECT Product, SUM(TotalSales) AS Highest_sale_value
          FROM SalesData
            GROUP BY Product
              ORDER BY Highest_sale_value desc```

iv. Calculate total revenue per product

   ```SELECT Product, SUM(TotalSales) AS Total_revenue
        FROM SalesData
          GROUP BY Product
            ORDER BY Total_revenue DESC```

v. Calculate monthly sales totals for the current year

    ```SELECT MONTH(orderdate) AS Sales_month,
         SUM(TotalSales) AS TOTAL_SALES
          FROM SalesData
           WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = YEAR(GETDATE())
            GROUP BY MONTH(OrderDate)
             ORDER BY Sales_month```

vi. Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount

   ```SELECT TOP 5 Customer_Id, SUM(TotalSales) AS TOTAL_SALES
       FROM SalesData
        GROUP BY Customer_Id
         ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES```

vii. Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.

   ```SELECT REGION, SUM(TotalSales) AS TOTAL_SALES,
       (SUM(TotalSales) / (SELECT SUM(TotalSales)
        FROM SalesData)) * 100 AS PERCENTAGETOTAL_SALES
         FROM SalesData
          GROUP BY REGION
           ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES```

viii. Identify products with no sales in the last quarter

   ```SELECT Product, Region
       FROM SalesData
        WHERE Product NOT IN (
         SELECT Product
          FROM SalesData
           WHERE OrderDate >=
            DATEADD (QUARTER, -1, GETDATE()))```


### PROJECT 2 Procedure:

### 1. Using Excel:

i. Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.

REGION BY ACTIVE SUBSCRIPTION  	
Region	Sum of Active Subscription
East	 18,750 
North	 7,500 
South	 7,500 
West	 7,500 
Grand Total	 41,250

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a9431d2-c970-49a9-a352-b06982ae7539)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/472d31a4-13b6-40dd-9515-49315836e0d8)


Here the EAST REGION has the higest number of ACTIVE Subscribers signaling high retention rate and Customers satisfaction.

While the remaining three Regions has the same number of active Subscribers but very far below the Eastern Region, quality and cost of the product should be looked into.

REGION BY CHURN SUBSCRIPTION/ATTRITION 	
Region	Sum of Churn /attrition
East	0
North	 11,250 
South	 11,250 
West	 11,250 
Grand Total	 33,750

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37645238-6fd1-4f60-bf93-1d16e7655fbe)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feab134c-113f-4c1c-a4b9-19bc5c62dcad)


Here, East Region has zero attrition, which means they have high retention rate, which signals high customers satisfaction.

With other 3 remaining regions having same number of attrition signaling that customers satisfaction should be enhanced and product quality and affordability should be looked into.

CUSTOMER BY SUBSCRIPTION DURATION	
Customer Name	Sum of SubscriptionDuration in Days
Alex	 1,368,750 
Anna	 1,368,750 
Chris	 1,368,750 
Dan	 1,372,500 
Ella	 1,368,750 
Eva	 1,368,750 
Grace	 1,372,500 
James	 1,368,750 
Jane	 1,368,750 
John	 1,368,750 
Liam	 1,368,750 
Maria	 1,368,750 
Mike	 1,368,750 
Nina	 1,372,500 
Paul	 1,372,500 
Rob	 1,372,500 
Sara	 1,368,750 
Sophia	 1,372,500 
Tom	 1,368,750 
Zoe	 1,372,500 
Grand Total	 27,401,250
